# Supported Coding Agents

Operator orchestrates AI coding agents to work on tickets from your kanban board. The following agents are currently supported:

## Available Agents

| Agent | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|

| [Codex](/getting-started/agents/codex/) | Supported | OpenAI's coding model |
| [Gemini CLI](/getting-started/agents/gemini-cli/) | Experimental | Google's AI assistant |

## Agent Capabilities

Each agent can:

- Read and understand ticket requirements
- Browse project codebases
- Write and modify code
- Run tests and builds
- Create pull requests

## Choosing an Agent

**Claude** is recommended for most users due to its strong code understanding and generation capabilities. See individual agent pages for setup instructions and specific features.
