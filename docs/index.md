Welcome friend! **Operator!** is an application for orchestrating Claude Code (and other LLM coding assist) agents across multi-project codebases. It combines kanban-style ticket management with LLM tools and tmux terminals to create a powerful workflow for managing AI-assisted development.

## What is <span class="operator-brand">Operator!</span>?

<span class="operator-brand">Operator!</span> helps you:

- **Manage ticket queues** - Organize and prioritize ticket shaped work into reproducible workflows.
- **Launch LLM agents** - Start Claude Code sessions with context from tickets and established software development standards.
- **Track progress** - Monitor agent status and work completion in real-time, keeping you in focus of what needs to get done.
- **Parallelize Work** - Work multiple tickets at once, across many code repositories, to get the most of your credits.
- **Enforce Standards** - Define how work gets done by AI tools, across many defined software services.
- **Catalog your Code** - Get the overview of your codebase, composed from project files, organized and maintained implicitly.

## Getting Started

1. Install <span class="operator-brand">Operator!</span> (downloads page)
2. Configure your project management kanban workspaces
3. Define your work shape issuetypes, and how AI combines them together
3. Create tickets in `.tickets/queue/` (kanban connectors)
4. Launch agents and watch them work (measuring success)
