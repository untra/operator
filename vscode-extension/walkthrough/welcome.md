Welcome friend! **Operator!** is an application for orchestrating [Claude Code](/getting-started/agents/claude/) (and other [LLM coding agents](/getting-started/agents/)) across multi-repository codebases. It connects to [kanban-style ticket management software](/getting-started/kanban/) , and will spawn terminal sessions within **VS Code** with prompts preprepared to create powerful workflows for managing AI-assisted software development.

**Operator!** runs in the directory containing your work code repositories, where it can synchronize and direct markdown defined work orders under a `.tickets/` directory which stores your kanban synchronized work tickets.

## Getting Started

1. Confirm the **Operator!** runtime `.tickets/` directory
2. Configure your project management kanban providers
3. Install an LLM Coding Agent
4. Download and configure the **Operator!** API server
5. Start Orchestrating your work!
